# Data Science & Machine Learning

This folder holds concise, reusable examples and tools for practical data science and machine learning work — from learning python basics (in notebook format rather than python scripts) to explicit and deeper data science & machine learning work like data ingestion and exploratory analysis to feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and lightweight deployment. Use it as a living reference and starter kit for future projects and experiments.

Purpose:
- Keep runnable notebooks for exploration and demos.
- Store reusable code (src), experiments, and saved models.
- Maintain small sample datasets or links and simple data documentation.
- Track evaluation results and quick deployment examples.

How to use:
- Open notebooks for interactive exploration.
- Import src modules in scripts and experiments.
- Add new experiments under a clear folder with notes and metrics.
- Keep README updated with usage and dependencies.

This file is updated often based on the changes that are being made to this specific repo.

Enjoy!
